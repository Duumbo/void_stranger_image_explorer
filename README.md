# VoidStranger Image Explorer
Just a small scuffed program to explore the brand of the second void Lord.

## Compiling
Compile using `cargo` for best compatibility. This was originally developped
for Linux, but since it uses `raylib`, it should compile on other targets.
Your mileage may vary.
```bash
cargo run -r
```

## Controls
There are two cursors, and you can swap images between cursors.
- Cursor 1
    - Move using `h` `j` `k` `l`
- Cursor 2
    - Move using `a` `d` `f` `g`
- Swap images using `s`
- Save current layout to file using `<Enter>`
    - Saved image will not draw the cursors.


Enjoy :)
